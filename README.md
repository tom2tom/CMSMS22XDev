# CMSMS22XDev
Here be no dragons. Merely an effective, good-looking, bugfixed, extensively-tested version of [CMS Made Simple](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org) version 2.2.

Suitable for PHP's 7.1 to 8.3.

Formerly destined to become a CMSMS 2.2 micro-release.

The one that got away. Anyone interested, put a line in the water and reel this one in.

For testing and evalutation purposes, installers are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/e1v1s5n8ng4c4cxhycm8y/h?rlkey=s101jz0ic0dpmh5xn7md52hvw&dl=0).

To be completely clear **this is not a CMSMS release, actual or official or any other status**.
