# CMSMS22XDev
Here be no dragons. Merely an effective, good-looking, bugfixed, extensively-tested version of [CMS Made Simple](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org) version 2.2.

Suitable for PHP's 7.1 to 8.3.

Once destined to become a CMSMS 2.2 micro-release.

The one that got away. Anyone interested, put a line in the water and reel this one in.
