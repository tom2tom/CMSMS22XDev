# CMSMS22XDev
Here be no dragons. Merely an effective, good-looking, bugfixed, extensively-tested version of [CMS Made Simple](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org) version 2.2.

Suitable for PHP's 7.1 to 8.3.

Formerly destined to become a CMSMS 2.2 micro-release.

The one that got away. Anyone interested, put a line in the water and reel this one in.

For testing and evalutation purposes, installers are available [here](https://github.com/tom2tom/CMSMS22XDev/tree/2219%232/phar_installer/out).

To be completely clear **this is not a CMSMS release, actual or official or any other status**.
