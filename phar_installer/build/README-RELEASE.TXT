Creating a CMSMS Release
------------------------

Creating a CMSMS release involves these steps:
  a: Do all of the required changes to the CMSMS branch in question (change the version.php, update the changelog, make sure those files are committed)
  b: Create the <installer root>/app/upgrade/<version> directory and its appropriate files
     MANIFEST.DAT -- this file is created with the 'create_manifest.php' script (see below)
     (a MANIFEST.DAT.GZ file is acceptable too)
     upgrade.php  -- (optional) the script to do any changes to the database or settings
        note: when this script is executed $db is available, the CMSMS api is created, however smarty is not available.
     readme.txt   -- (optional) readme file for display in the upgrade assistant
     changelog.txt -- (recommended) a text file describing specific changes to that version
  c: optionally delete directories from <installer root>/app/upgrade that are no longer necessary.
  d: optionally changing <installer root>/app/config.ini to specify the minimum upgrade version.
  d: commit those changes to SVN
  e: build the release packages (see below)
  f: ** Begin distribution process **
     - remember to create an svn tag if distributing

---------------------
Building the files manifest
---------------------
1. Execute the create_manifest.php script 
     - this requires the php-cli package
     - requires subversion installed
     - assumes unix/linux
     - this script requires an svn root directory, a from subpath, and a to subpath
       i.e: 
         root directory:  http://svn.cmsmadesimple.org/svn/cmsmadesimple
         from subpath:    branches/1.11.x
         to subpath:      trunk
     - the script exports the two directories, and (accounting for files that need to be excluded) compares the directories to
       find files that have been added/changed/deleted.
2. Copy the generated MANIFEST.DAT.GZ file into the <root>/app/upgrade/<version> directory

-----------------------------
Building the release packages
-----------------------------
1.  Change dir into the build directory
    Note:  You only need the phar_installer directory to do a build... but use caution that it is from the proper branch of cmsms.

2.  Execute build_release.php script
    -- execute build_release.php -h for help
    ** This script is only tested on linux (I'm allergic to windoze)
 
    ** This script requires a bit of configuration
   
    a: requires the php-cli package
       (from ubuntu:  sudo apt-get install php5-cgi)

    b: requires that the php-cli package be allowed (in its configuration) to create phar files
       (from ubuntu:  vi /etc/php5/cli/php.ini; set phar.readonly = Off;)
    
    c: requires subversion to be installed and configured
       (from ubuntu:  sudo apt-get install subversion)

    d: requires zip to be installed and configured
       (from ubuntu:  sudo apt-get install zip)
 
    ** This script executes multiple steps

    a: Exports the CMSMS svn from the path specified in the svn_url at the top of the script
       The path is hard coded to the cmsmadesimple trunk (for now)

    b: It will then clean all of the files that do not belong in the release
       (i.e: remove scripts, tests, svn and git files, backup files etc)

    c: Checksum files are created in the out directory.
 
    d: Resulting files are tarred up into data/data.tar.gz
       The version.php file for the trunk version is also copied here for convenience in knowing what the user will be installing or upgrading to.

    e: A self contained executable .phar file is created and renamed to .php (because most http servers don't accept .phar extensions by default)
   
    f: The .php file is encapsulated into a .zip file (this makes the file easy to share on a server, as the http server won't try to execute it)

    g: The installer, and the data.tar.gz is zipped into a zip file (allows CMSMS to be installed on older systems)

-----------------------
Running the .phar file
-----------------------

Most Apache servers are not configured (by default) to execute php for .phar files.
Here are two solutions:
  1.  Rename the .phar to .php and then browse to it.
      (the build_release script does that, and then encapsulates the .php file into a .zip file)

  2.  Tell Apache to include .phar files in its executable list. 
      i.e: add this to the .htaccess (may require changing for different server configs)

      <FilesMatch "\.ph(ar|p3?|tml)$">
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
      </FilesMatch>
