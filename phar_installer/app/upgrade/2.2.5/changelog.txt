Version 2.2.5 - Wawa
----------------------------------
Core - General
  - Fix minor security issue in the way login information was cached in cookies and the session.
  - Simplify rules around alias editing/generation in fillparams.
    If the alias field exists then we can adjust its value or recalculate an alias.
    Use basic properties, and ownership and permissions to determine if that field exists on the edit form.
  - Minor fixes to the CmsJobManager.
